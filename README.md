# Episode Renamer
Requires tkinter, guizero, os.

Batch file renamer written in Python.

The primary goal of this project is to be able to make several *similar* changes to multiple video filenames at a time.

The other goals are to be usable in Windows or Linux without modification (will probably work on Mac as well, but I don't have one on hand for testing)

Currently there is no real functionality, only some parts of the GUI have been added, and I am working on the logic behind adding/removing GUI widgets procedurally.
