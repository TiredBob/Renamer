# Renamer
Requires guizero
Batch file renamer written in Python.
The primary goal of this project is to be able to make several *similar* changes to multiple files at a time.
The other goals are to be usable in Windows or Linux without modification. 

Currently there is no real functionality, only some parts of the GUI have been added, and I am working on the logic behind adding/removing GUI widgets procedurally.
